# Running
Node JS needs to be installed and the ws libary should be obtained from npm. The server.js file needs to be ran on a server like device then the client html pages loaded in other client devices. Based on what the IP of server the code will have to be modified.

Major setbacks minutes before the subbmission was due part of the display procces broke entirely. Getting the sorting algorithm to work properly was also a major challange as it broke many times and took the full time of a project memeber to get working.

# Imporvments
The visuals and the sorting algorithm could be retooled

# Frameworks
This used node js and the ws libary
